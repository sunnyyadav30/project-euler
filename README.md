# Project Euler Solutions in JavaScript

Welcome to my repository for solving **Project Euler** problems using JavaScript! This project contains my solutions to the problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), which is a platform for solving challenging mathematical and computational problems.

## What is Project Euler?

Project Euler is a collection of mathematical and computational problems designed to require more than just mathematical insight to solve. It focuses on problem-solving techniques, algorithm optimization, and efficient coding practices.

The problems cover a variety of topics, including number theory, combinatorics, geometry, and graph theory, and aim to improve both your mathematical and coding skills.

You can find more information on Project Euler and access the problems at [https://projecteuler.net/](https://projecteuler.net/).

## Repository Overview

This repository contains my solutions to Project Euler problems implemented in **JavaScript**. Each problem has its own folder and the corresponding solution script.

- Each folder contains:
  - `solution.js`: The JavaScript code for solving the problem.
  - `README.md` (optional): Explanation of the approach used to solve the problem (if needed).

## Problem Solving Approach

I strive to solve each problem using:
- **Efficient algorithms**: To avoid brute force solutions and ensure optimal performance.
- **Clean, modular code**: Making the code easy to understand and modify.
- **JavaScript-specific techniques**: Taking advantage of JavaScriptâ€™s built-in features, such as `BigInt`, closures, and array methods.
